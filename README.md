#### Video Presentation: (https://youtu.be/SgjZKZg_96Q)

## Description:
The Cricket Tournament Analysis Tool is a Python application designed to analyze cricket tournament data and provide valuable insights into team performance, player statistics, visualizations, and overall tournament dynamics. This tool processes data from CSV files containing information about matches, teams, players, runs scored, wickets taken, and more. It calculates various metrics such as net run rate (NRR), batting average, bowling average, and economy rate to assess team and player performance.

## Files:
### project.py
The `project.py` file contains the main codebase for the project. It includes functions for reading cricket data from CSV files, calculating team statistics, visualizing runs scored by each team, determining the best batsman and bowler, and visualizing batsman and bowler statistics.

### test_project.py
The `test_project.py` file contains unit tests for the functions implemented in `project.py`. It utilizes the pytest framework to ensure the correctness of the codebase. The tests cover various scenarios, including reading cricket data, calculating team statistics, and determining the best batsman and bowler.

### data-sets/cricket_data.csv
The `cricket_data.csv` file contains raw data for the cricket tournament, including information about teams, runs scored, runs conceded, and overs played. This data is used by the `project.py` file to perform calculations and derive insights.

### data-sets/batsman_data.csv
The `batsman_data.csv` file contains data specific to batsmen, including their names, runs scored, balls faced, fours hit, and sixes hit. This data is utilized to determine the best batsman in the tournament.

### data-sets/bowler_data.csv
The `bowler_data.csv` file contains data specific to bowlers, including their names, overs bowled, wickets taken, and runs conceded. This data is used to determine the best bowler in the tournament based on wickets taken and economy rate.

## Design Choices:
### Utilization of Libraries:
The project leverages popular Python libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and numpy to streamline data processing, analysis, and visualization tasks. These libraries provide efficient and convenient tools for handling large datasets and generating meaningful insights.

### Modular Codebase:
The codebase is organized into separate functions and files, each responsible for a specific task or analysis. This modular design promotes code reusability, readability, and maintainability, making it easier to extend and enhance the functionality of the project in the future.

### Comprehensive Testing:
The `test_project.py` file includes comprehensive unit tests to validate the correctness of the implemented functions. By testing various scenarios and edge cases, we ensure the reliability and robustness of the codebase, minimizing the risk of errors or bugs.

### Visualizations:
The project incorporates visualizations such as bar charts to present key metrics and insights visually. Visualizations enhance the interpretability of the data, allowing stakeholders to grasp complex patterns and trends more effectively.

### Data Integrity:
Efforts have been made to ensure data integrity and consistency throughout the project. Data validation and error handling mechanisms are implemented to handle potential issues such as missing values or invalid entries, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the analysis results.

## Future Enhancements:
1. Interactive Dashboard: Implementing an interactive dashboard using libraries like Plotly or Dash to provide users with an intuitive interface for exploring cricket tournament data.

2. Additional Metrics: Incorporating more advanced metrics such as player strike rates, team win-loss ratios, and match summaries to offer comprehensive analysis.

3. Machine Learning Models: Introducing machine learning models to predict match outcomes, identify key performance indicators, and suggest strategies for teams.

4. Real-Time Data Integration: Enabling real-time data integration to analyze ongoing matches and provide live updates on team and player statistics.

5. User Interface Improvements: Enhancing the user interface with interactive charts, customizable dashboards, and user-friendly navigation options for a better user experience.

## Conclusion:
Cricket Tournament Analysis provides a comprehensive framework for analyzing cricket tournament data and extracting valuable insights to support decision-making and performance evaluation. By leveraging Python's powerful data analysis capabilities and visualization tools, the project offers a robust solution for cricket enthusiasts, coaches, and analysts to gain deeper insights into the dynamics of cricket tournaments.
